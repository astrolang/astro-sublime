## Installation

### via Package Control (Recommended)
[Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) is a package manager for Sublime Text 2 & 3.  If you don't already have it installed, follow the [installation instructions here](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).

Once Package Control is installed, restart Sublime and follow these steps:
* Open the Command Pallette (`cmd + shift + p` on OS X / Linux or `ctrl + shift + p` on Windows)
* Type "install" and select "Package Control: Install Package"
* Type "swift" and press Enter

All done! Package Control will automatically update the package whenever there's a new version.
